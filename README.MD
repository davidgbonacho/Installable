# Installable web app
Make a web app installable (html or php files) in order to create a PWA or SPA application.

`[SimPIL are a series of ultra-simple examples of how to perform different operations with code. Uncomplicated.]`

## Install
Simply clone the repo in HTTPS server. (Note that the manifest is prepared to be executed in the document root, if it is another directory, indicate it in the manifest load sentence in HTML/PHP file).

## Perform
Load your application from the browser and it can be installed on your device. Note that the protocol must be https. Note that the correct location of the manifest.json file must be specified in the <link> tag within the <head> (and it should contain the correct location [relative to the root of the deployed site] of the referenced files)."

Here is an example of the deployed code: [https://davidgbonacho.github.io/Installable_web/](https://davidgbonacho.github.io/Installable_web/)

## Files
- index.html: an ultra-simple HTML document 
- manifest.json: with the name of your web app and logo file locations
- img: location of logo fil
